üîß How It Works
Working Hours (8 AM to 8 PM):
The script checks if any of the websites in the block list are missing from the hosts file. If not already present, it appends entries like 127.0.0.1, effectively redirecting them to localhost and preventing access.

Non-Working Hours (Before 8 AM and After 8 PM):
The script scans the hosts file and removes any lines related to the blocked websites, restoring access.

The script runs in a loop, checking every 5 seconds.

üìù Features
Time-based automatic website blocking/unblocking

Customizable list of websites to block

Real-time monitoring with 5-second intervals

Uses the system-level hosts file (requires admin privileges on Windows)

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Python 3.x

Windows OS

Must run the script as Administrator to allow editing the system hosts file

üìå Note
For safety or testing, modify the host_path in the script to point to a temporary file instead of the actual hosts file. You can rename the script to .pyw to make it run silently without opening a terminal window.
